                    My name is Jordan Sukhnandan. I am a Computer Science student currently attending Hunter College and am seeking an opportunity to gain relevant software engineering work experience. Recently I have been actively trying to perform in hackathon(s), build applications, learn new programming languages, and practice my coding skills learned from school.
                    <br><br>
                    My work experience in retail has given me the experience to work on a team and develop key communication skills to effectively perform assignments and satisfy company demands. Some of my pasttime hobbies include things such as studying foreign languages, cooking, and exercising.
                    <br><br>
                    You can view the various projects I have worked on as well as my education and work experiences via the sidebar on the left.
